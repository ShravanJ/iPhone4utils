SetupPwner - by Shravan Jambukesan (@shrav_j)
Made possible by msftguy for ssh_rd and semaphore for TinyUmbrella

*Requires Java and TinyUmbrella to be installed*

1. Open up the app
2. Click SSH into ramdisk
3. Click ok and run ssh_rd.jar
4. After sshâ€™ing into device, keep that window open
5. Open the app back up and click Remove Setup.app
6. Once that has finished up, restart the app and click Kick out of Recovery
7. In TinyUmbrella, choose the device connected and choose Exit Recovery at the top of the screen.

This app has not been tested and is likely to be ridiculously buggy. Like always, use at your own risk as I am not responsible for any damage to the device, the computer running the script, or the user.

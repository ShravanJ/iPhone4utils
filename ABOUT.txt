Welcome to iPhone4utils by Shravan Jambukesan (@shrav_j)

Work in progress - not all scripts will work properly. Some of the scripts listed below have not been developed yet as of 5/11/14.

This project contains a few AppleScripts that could come in handy for playing around with your iPhone 4 or other limera1n-able device.

Thanks to:

winch’s opensn0w (used in sn0wmaker)
msftguy’s ssh_rd tool (used in SetupPwner and SSHBuddy)
planetbeing’s xpwn
George Hotz for limera1n
semaphore’s TinyUmbrella (used in SetupPwner)

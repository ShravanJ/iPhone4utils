sn0wmaker - by Shravan Jambukesan (@shrav_j)
This script allows you to quickly build winocm's awesome opensn0w utility on a machine running a Debian based GNU/Linux distribution. 

To use this, simply place sn0wmaker.sh in an easily accessible location such as your Desktop or Documents directory. Then cd into the directory (Ex: cd Desktop), and type in chmod +x snowmaker.sh. Now you can run it by typing in
./sn0wmaker.sh

That is it. sn0wmaker will automatically download and install all the dependencies you need and run autogen and make for you. Building opensn0w has never been easier!

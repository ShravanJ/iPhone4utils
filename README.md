iPhone4utils
============

A few AppleScripts to do fun stuff with an iPhone 4. 
They probably will never really be used, but whatever, I needed something to do before I went to bed :P

These scripts are probably buggy and have not even been tested with the device, however, since Terminal handles them well enough, I am assuming they work just fine. 

The scripts will work on any device that supports the limera1n exploit, not just the iPhone 4. I named it iPhone4utils
just because I have an iPhone 4 :P

This is a work in progress. More scripts will be added sooner or later. Please don't rant if they don't work.

This project contains contains and uses work from
msftguy - ssh_rd
winocm - opensn0w
semaphore - TinyUmbrella
and various other people. 
Appropriate credit has been given where needed. All scripts are written by me, Shravan Jambukesan.

I will add a license to this project later, I gotta get some sleep now ;)
